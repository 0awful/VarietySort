# VarietySort

Inspired by the world changing reddit post, variety sort is changing the sorting game forever.

[Take a look at the algorithm here](https://i.redd.it/xmh10hvt4lr01.png) 

Did you want deterministic performance AND non-determininistic performance?
Did you want O(n log(n)) performance and O(n^2) performance?

With variety sort you can get all that and more.

Infinitely extensible you can add as many sorting algorithms as you desire. In paralell, in series.
On background threads that never terminate.
